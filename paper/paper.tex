\IEEEraisesectionheading{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}}
\IEEEPARstart{N}{euroimaging} datasets have significantly grown in size in the past decade,
resulting in Petabytes of data. As a result, processing pipelines have now shifted from compute to 
data intensive. Some efforts have been made to reduce the data transfer costs in neuroimaging by
introducing new methods to generate pipelines, such as through the adoption of Big Data frameworks
like Apache Spark \cite{Spark} for the pipeline definition \cite{thunder} \cite{other papers}. 
However, such pipelines would have to be entirely rewritten for the framework of choice and Big Data
frameworks like Spark and Dask were found to be difficult to use in describing neuroimaging pipelines \cite{mehta}.
Furthermore, the neuroimaging community relies heavily on the use of well-established command-line tools \cite{fsl, afni, freesurfer}, resulting in
data transfers being inevitable, even with a Big Data framework. 

High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters are often the infrastructure of choice for researchers looking to processing their data.
While there are many benefits to using such clusters, such as large amounts of resources available at little to no cost to
the researchers, the resources are shared amongst users concurrently. 

% add need for userspace / intelligent pipeline flushing
% there is no one-size fits all with data intensive applications
% due to io patterns, so we decided with userspace.

Goal - leverage local storage to speed up computation/Sea

% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
%


\appendices
% you can choose not to have a title for an appendix
% if you want by leaving the argument blank
\section{}
Appendix two text goes here.
